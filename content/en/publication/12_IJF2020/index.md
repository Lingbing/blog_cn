title: "Forecasting mortality with a hyperbolic spatial temporal VAR
model"
abstract: "Accurate forecasts of mortality rates are essential to various types of demographic
research like population projection, and to the pricing of insurance products such
as pensions and annuities. Recent studies have considered a spatial–temporal vector
autoregressive (STVAR) model for the mortality surface, where mortality rates of each
age depend on the historical values for that age (temporality) and the neighboring
cohorts ages (spatiality). This model has sound statistical properties including co-
integrated dependent variables, the existence of closed-form solutions and a simple
error structure. Despite its improved forecasting performance over the famous Lee–
Carter (LC) model, the constraint that only the effects of the same and neighboring
cohorts are significant can be too restrictive. In this study, we adopt the concept of
hyperbolic memory to the spatial dimension and propose a hyperbolic STVAR (HSTVAR)
model. Retaining all desirable features of the STVAR, our model uniformly beats the
LC, the weighted functional demographic model, STVAR and sparse VAR counterparties
for forecasting accuracy, when French and Spanish mortality data over 1950–2016 are
considered. Simulation results also lead to robust conclusions. Long-term forecasting
analyses up to 2050 comparing the four models are further performed. To illustrate the
extensible feature of HSTVAR to a multi-population case, a two-population illustrative
example using the same sample is further presented."
